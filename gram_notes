add:
	print round scores along with winning curve, as once they add up, cant tell
	background music?
	^ or, noise on score start...
	ordering or lowest score on score draw
	output score.txt at end?
	crosshair on cursor location

	DEFINITELY: 

    animation on round winner score, comparing to data
	^ add comparison? maybe red above, blue below....
    round count --> so like: ROUND: X/N
    highlight final winning score (lowest)


maybe add:
	buttons to enter player names
	animation / cutscreen for each question: display question in big letters, then ask for plotting


python3 freeze.py py2app --packages=wx
Correlation_test.app/Contents/MacOS/Correlation_test "c"



HOW:
	crosshair - in general drawing calls... No!
				if click, hold, over draw box, draw crosshair there

	gray grid - in general drawing calls, do this first, pygame lines should be enough






OLD CODE:

    if kind == "trend": 
        a = datetime(int(date1[:4]), int(date1[5:7]), int(date1[8:]))
        b = datetime(int(date2[:4]), int(date2[5:7]), int(date2[8:]))
        return str(a + (b - a)/2)[:10]


        dt = clock.tick()
        colorchange = colorchange + dt
        print(colorchange, colorchange%800)
        if colorchange % maxchange == 0 and colorchange % maxchange < maxchange/2:
            pg.draw.rect(screen, next_box.color, next_box.rect)
            readysurf = reallybigfont.render("I'M READY", True, BLUE)
            screen.blit(readysurf, (next_box.rect.x+115,next_box.rect.y+22))
            pg.display.update(next_box.rect)
        if colorchange % maxchange >= maxchange/2:
            pg.draw.rect(screen, next_box.color, next_box.rect)
            readysurf = reallybigfont.render("I'M READY", True, ORANGE)
            screen.blit(readysurf, (next_box.rect.x+115,next_box.rect.y+22))
            pg.display.update(next_box.rect)
